<h1>Stack Frame Format  in the Shared Source CLI 2.0</h1>

<p>When executing just-in-time (JIT) compiled code in the Shared Source Common 
Language Infrastructure 
(SSCLI), there are two managed native calling conventions used on
    the x86 for just-in-time (JIT) compiled code.
</p>
<p>Note: In non-JIT-compiled code, such as helper stubs, other calling 
conventions are at work, so do not expect to see a completely homogenous stack. 
All calls to or from JIT-compiled code  follow the calling convention, but 
calls between non-JIT-compiled components can follow other conventions.
</p>

<h3>
    Standard x86 calling convention</h3>
    <p>
        The standard native calling convention is a variation on the fastcall convention
        used by the VC++ compiler. It differs primarily in the order in which arguments
        are pushed on the stack. The only values that can be passed in registers are managed
        and unmanaged pointers, object references, and the built-in integer types int8,
        unsigned int8, int16, unsigned int16, int32, unsigned it32, native int, native unsigned
        int, and enums and value types with only one primitive-type field. Enums are passed
        as their underlying type. All floating-point values and 8-byte integer values are
        passed on the stack. When the return type is a value type that cannot be passed
        in a register, the caller shall create a buffer to hold the result and pass the
        address of this buffer as a hidden parameter.
    </p>
    <p>
        Arguments are passed in left-to-right order, starting with the this pointer (for
        instance and virtual methods), followed by the return buffer pointer if needed,
        followed by the user-specified argument values. The first of these that can be placed
        in a register is put into ECX, the next in EDX, and all subsequent ones are passed
        on the stack.
    </p>
    <p>
        The return value is handled as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Floating-point values are returned on the top of the hardware FP stack.</li>
        <li>Integers up to 32 bits long are returned in EAX.</li>
        <li>64-bit integers are passed with EAX holding the least significant 32 bits and EDX
            holding the most significant 32 bits.</li>
        <li>All other cases require the use of a return buffer, through which the value is returned.
            In addition, there is a guarantee that if a return buffer is used a value is stored
            there only upon ordinary exit from the method. The buffer is not allowed to be used
            for temporary storage within the method and its contents will be unaltered if an
            exception occurs while executing the method.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <h4>
        Example:</h4>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <code>static System.Int32 f(int32 x)</code><br />
        The incoming argument (x) is placed in ECX; the return value is in EAX
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <code>static float64 f(int32 x, int32 y, int32 z)</code>
        <br />
        x is passed in ECX, y in EDX, z on the top of stack; the return value is on the
        top of the floating-point (FP) stack
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <code>static float64 f(int32 x, float64 y, int32 z)</code>
        <br />
        x is passed in ECX, y on the top of the stack (not FP stack), z in EDX; the return
        value is on the top of the FP stack
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <code>virtual float64 f(int32 x, int64 y, int64 z)</code> 
        <br />
        this is passed in ECX, x in EDX, y
        pushed on the stack, then z pushed on the stack (hence z is top of the stack); the
        return value is on the top of the FP stack
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <code>virtual int64 f(int32 x, float64 y, float64 z)</code>
        <br />
        this is passed in ECX, x in EDX,
        y pushed on the stack, then z pushed on the stack (hence z is on top of the stack);
        the return value is in EDX/EAX
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <code>
        virtual [mscorlib]System.Guid f(int32 x, float64 y, float64 z)</code>
        <br />
        Since System.Guid is a value type the this pointer is passed in ECX, a pointer to
        the return buffer is passed in EDX, x is pushed, then y, and then z (hence z is
        on top the of stack); the return value is stored in the return buffer.</blockquote>
    <h3>
        Vararg x86 calling convention</h3>
    <p>
        All user-specified arguments are passed on the stack, pushed in left-to-right order.
        Following the last argument (hence on top of the stack upon entry to the method
        body) a special opaque “handle to argument type data” is passed which provides information
        about the types of the arguments that have been pushed. The caller is responsible
        for popping off the arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
        As with the standard calling convention, the this pointer and a return buffer (if
        either is needed) are passed in ECX and/or EDX. Values are returned in the same
        way as for the standard calling convention.</p>

<h3>FCALL Matching</h3>
<p>The order of parameters to an FCALL (see fcall.h) has to match the JIT 
calling convention described above, instead of matching the
function signature as it appears in the framework classes. In fcall.h there are a number of macros to help in converting an 
CIL-style signature to the JIT calling convention.
