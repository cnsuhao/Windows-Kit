#ifndef SETUP_STATE_H
#define SETUP_STATE_H

/* The purpose of this file is to contain all the global variables
   that define the "state" of the install, that is, all the
   information that the user has provided so far.  These are set by
   the various dialogs and used by the various actions. 
 
   Note that this is deprecated. Persistent settings should be accessed
   via a class that stores them cross-installs, and non-persistent settings
   directly via the appropriate class. One of the reasons for this is that
   non-trivial types would require this file to include appropriate headers,
   making all of setup.exe rebuild for potentially minor changes.
