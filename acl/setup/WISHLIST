WISHLIST:
---------
 * Support rpm/deb files for reading the package from. (To allow the
   maintainers the use of rpm/deb tools to create packages.)
 * Make a librar(y|ies) for setup and cygcheck to use containing
   1) Something to translate POSIX -> native.  Currently called "cygpath"
      in setup, although this is probably a bad choice of name.
   2) Something to return the list of installed packages.
   3) Something to return the cygwin mount table.  Currently, I have implemented
      a lightweight setmntent and getmntent using the code in
   4) Something to parse a tar file name into package/version or alternatively,
      return that information from 2)
   5) Something to return a list of files associated with a package.
 * Mark versions as prev/curr/test in the GUI when clicking through them.
 * Make setup.exe available through Add/Remove
 * Local package scan stops updating when it stops being the active window.
 * Some way to download *all* the source.
 * Incremental/recoverable download capability.
 * Build-depends.
 * FTP control connections should be closed when we are awaiting user input.
 * Show a sdesc for each category.
 * Add friendly error reporting to simpsock.cc.
 * Scan newly installed files for README files, show list to user, let them
   read them if they want.
 * Clicking on a package that is in multiple categories should update the view
   of the package in both locations on screen. - Done?
 * Remember the view mode - ie if you leave setup in partial, it returns to
   partial automatically.
 * Downloading from the internet should be _able_ to list based on what is
   present in the cache, as opposed to what is installed. (To help building a
   complete install set for a different machine).
 * New view - "action / category / package"
 * New view - show installed packages only. Probably not categorised.
 * Don't ask about the start menu or desktop options if they already exist.
 * Save the manual proxy settings so they don't need to be retyped.
 * Detect files in multiple packages.
 * Show bin and src download size.
 * Confirm cancellation of setup if in the middle of doing something.
 * Improve mirror selection UI.
 * Ability to "hold" the version of a package - i.e. never auto-upgrade.
